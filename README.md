# IP Location Service

The **IP Location Service** is a Node.js application that provides location and security related information based on an IP address. This service integrates geolocation and security features, including country-based access restriction suggestions.

## Features

- **Location Lookup**: Retrieve detailed location data for a specified IP address.
- **IP History Tracking**: Store and retrieve historical location data for IP addresses.
- **Country-Based Access Suggestions**: Suggest access restrictions for high-risk countries.
- **Security-Focused**: Designed for cybersecurity applications, providing insights for IP-based risk management.
